# Kingdom Builder - Java Programming Project

Welcome to the **Kingdom Builder** project! This was a high school group project focused on creating a **local multiplayer board game** in Java. Our goal was to design and implement an engaging strategy game where players build kingdoms and compete for dominance on the board.

## Project Overview

**Kingdom Builder** is a Java-based application that allows multiple players to participate locally. Players take turns building, expanding, and strategizing to maximize their kingdom's influence. The project emphasizes:

- Object-oriented programming principles in Java
- Interactive user interface designed with **SceneBuilder**
- Multiplayer functionality on a single machine
- Game state management and turn-based logic
